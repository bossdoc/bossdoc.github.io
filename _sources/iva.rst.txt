IVA
===

IVA is the intelligent voice assistant thar processes a query in free form natural language, extracts the ``intent`` and ``entities`` from it and maps the query to the relevant function that can respond to the query given the extracted entities. At it's core IVA uses a NLP understanding library ``snips-nlu`` for extracting the intent and entities from a query.

Training the NLP engine
-----------------------

Creating dataset
	Edit the files inside ``vast.views_boss_assistant/query_parsing_snips/parsing_data``. The data format should be self-explanatory, but to read more about it refer to snips-nlu documentation. 

	Edit the ``create_dataset.sh`` file inside ``vast.views_boss_assistant/query_parsing_snips`` to supply the right filepath to the target dataset json file to be saved in ``Data/NLU`` folder. Run ``sh create_dataset.sh`` to save the dataset.
Training
	Train the model by running the following from django shell::

		from vast.views_boss_assistant.query_parsing_snips import train_model
		train_model.train_model()
