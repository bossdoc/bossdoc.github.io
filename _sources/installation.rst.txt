Installation
============

Following installation guide assumes a Unix based operating system. Make sure you have Python 2.7 installed. You will also need to install MySql Client 5.6.

Getting the code
----------------

* Clone the root BOSS directory containing ``manage.py``, and ``Virtual_Arrival`` directory. 

	.. code-block:: bash

		git clone https://github.com/paarthneekhara/BOSS_root

* Download the data folder from `here <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qQ0sm4nmN9ACK0FKd6Kaaj45to_SqHc2/view?usp=sharing>`_, unzip it and place the ``Data`` directory inside ``BOSS_root``.

* Inside the ``BOSS_root`` directory clone ``vast``:

	.. code-block:: bash

		git clone https://github.com/paarthneekhara/vast

The directory structure after these steps should look something like this:

.. code-block:: text

	BOSS_root/
		|-Data/
		â”‚-vast/
		|-Virtual_Arrival/
		|-manage.py

* Next you will need to edit the ``Virtual_Arrival/settings.py`` and ``conftest.py`` for configuring mysql connection parameters of your machine.

Installing Dependencies
-----------------------
* create a Python 2.7 virtual enviroment in ``BOSS_root`` as follows. If your default python version is 2.7, the following would work, other wise specify Python 2.7 path using ``-p`` option.

	.. code-block:: bash

		virtualenv bossenv

* Install all dependencies using

	.. code-block:: bash

		pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the server
------------------
* If everything worked correctly, you should be run the server using:

	.. code-block:: bash

		python manage.py runserver

* The following login screen should come up on accessing ``http://localhost:8000/vast/user_login``
