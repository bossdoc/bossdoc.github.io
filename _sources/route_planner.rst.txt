==============
Idea: On selecting particular ship one can select different positions or selected ship's current position to find the simulation data for that ship for those routes.

* User is provided a table to fill details for the route. To select route, there is a dropdown for `Port/Vessel` from user can select any `Port` or `Vessel`
* User is also provided additional options such as, hiding all other vessels, showing all routing points, and an option to mark on map using which user can select any additional postion by clicking on a map.
* Once the user added the route, a polyline is generated to show the route, user will have options to edit, delete or copy the route according to their need.
* After the polyline is generated, user can now simulate and get data for added routes by clicking simulate button.
* Table will be generated for all the saved route, on clicking view summary details, summary for that route can be downloaded in pdf format.
